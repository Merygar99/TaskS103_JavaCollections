📚 **Java Collections – Practice Exercises**

🧩 **About This Repository**

This repository contains a curated set of exercises designed to practice and deepen understanding of the Java Collections Framework. It explores core concepts such as lists, sets, maps, iterators, sorting, and object comparison through real-world-inspired challenges and structured code examples.

📋 **Topics Covered**

  ✅ *Lists*
  - Using ArrayList and LinkedList

  - Maintaining insertion order

  - Accessing, modifying, and removing elements

  - Asserting contents and positions

  - Comparing lists with assertions

  ✅ *Sets*
  - Eliminating duplicates with HashSet

  - Maintaining order with LinkedHashSet and TreeSet

  - Set operations: union, intersection, difference

  - Testing presence of elements

  ✅ *Maps*
  - Storing key-value pairs with HashMap and TreeMap

  - Checking key existence (containsKey)

  - Iterating over entries

  - Performing assertions with map entries and keys

  ✅ *Optional*
  - Creating and validating empty or non-empty Optionals

  - Handling absent values with isEmpty() and isPresent()

  - Assertion patterns for Optionals

  ✅ *Object Identity vs Equality*
  - Asserting same instance with assertSame

  - Asserting content equality with assertEquals

  - Using equals() and hashCode() properly

  ✅ *Exception Handling*
  - Triggering and validating exceptions like ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException

  - Using assertThrows for expected exception behavior
