# 🚀 Collections Exercise

## 🧩 What’s This About?
This repository contains the solution to a programming exercise designed to strengthen my skills in Java development. The project showcases the implementation of core concepts using Java, version control with Git, and project management with IntelliJ IDEA.

## 📚 Exercise Overview
This repository contains one programming exercise focused on Collections in Java.

This exercise involves creating a Restaurant class with two attributes: name (String) and rating (int). In the main application, a HashSet is used to store Restaurant objects.

The key requirement is to prevent duplicate entries of restaurants that have both the same name and the same rating. However, restaurants with the same name but different ratings are allowed.

To enforce this behavior, the class must properly override the equals() and hashCode() methods.
