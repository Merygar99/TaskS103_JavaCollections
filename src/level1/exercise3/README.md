# 🚀 Collections Exercise

## 🧩 What’s This About?
This repository contains the solution to a programming exercise designed to strengthen my skills in Java development. The project showcases the implementation of core concepts using Java, version control with Git, and project management with IntelliJ IDEA.

## 📚 Exercise Overview
This repository contains one programming exercise focused on Collections in Java.

This program reads data from a file called countries.txt, which contains pairs of countries and their capitals. It stores this information in a HashMap<String, String>.

After prompting the user for their name, the program presents 10 random countries and asks the user to input the corresponding capital. For each correct answer, the user's score increases by one point.

At the end of the game, the user's name and score are saved in a file named classification.txt.
