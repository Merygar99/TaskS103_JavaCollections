# 🚀 Collections Exercise

## 🧩 What’s This About?
This repository contains the solution to a programming exercise designed to strengthen my skills in Java development. The project showcases the implementation of core concepts using Java, version control with Git, and project management with IntelliJ IDEA.

## 📚 Exercise Overview
This repository contains one programming exercise focused on Collections in Java.

This project involves creating a Java class named Month with a single attribute, name, to represent the months of the year. Initially, you'll add 11 Month objects (excluding "August") to an ArrayList, then insert the missing "August" month in the correct chronological position to verify the list maintains the proper order.

The exercise continues by converting the ArrayList into a HashSet to ensure duplicate months are not allowed.

Finally, the project requires iterating through the list twice—once using a traditional for loop and once using an Iterator.
