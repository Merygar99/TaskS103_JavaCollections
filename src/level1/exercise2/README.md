# 🚀 Collections Exercise

## 🧩 What’s This About?
This repository contains the solution to a programming exercise designed to strengthen my skills in Java development. The project showcases the implementation of core concepts using Java, version control with Git, and project management with IntelliJ IDEA.

## 📚 Exercise Overview
This repository contains one programming exercise focused on Collections in Java.

This task involves working with Java’s List<Integer> and ListIterator classes. First, you’ll create and populate a list of integers. Then, you’ll create a second list and fill it with the elements of the first list—but in reverse order.

To achieve this, the solution utilizes a ListIterator to traverse the original list and insert elements into the second list accordingly.
